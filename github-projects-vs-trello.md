# Github Projects vs Trello  

I didn't hear about [Github Projects](https://help.github.com/articles/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-projects/) until recently. Projects was designed to help teams organize their work and implement their own workflow directly within Github. The goal was to make it flexible and customizable so it could be useful for any workflow, team, or project, and to make it a part of Github so developers wouldn't need a new tool to install and configure and so they wouldn't have to leave Github.  

After I heard about Projects I looked into it to see if it could be of any use to me. After a few minutes with it I had mixed feelings. Honestly it looks promising and it even seems to be useful right now, but it felt like a very unashamed copy of Trello but without many of the features.  

If you aren't familiar with [Trello](), it is a project management app used for team collaboration and customizable workflow implementation. Sound familiar? The layout on Trello is list based; you define lists, and within each list you can add cards. As you work on the cards you can drag them between the lists to mean different things depending on your setup, and you can do all sorts of other things like comment on cards, assign users to cards, set due dates and dozens of other things.

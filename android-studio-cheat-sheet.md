## Android Studio Cheat Sheet and Shortcuts

If you have used Android Studio for even a short time I'm sure you have found some shortcuts and hot keys to speed up your coding and keep your hands on the keyboard where they belong! I'm going to run through some of the shortcuts I find most useful. Android Studio is built by Google, but it is based on Jetbrains Intellij Community Edition Java IDE. This means that all of the Intellij shortcut keys work on Android Studio, but Google have added a few of their own. Let's jump into some of the best ones.  

### Searching For A Shortcut
Stop me if this has happened to you before. You read an awesome tutorial on shortcuts and hot keys in Android Studio and found a few that looked really useful, but when you sit down and start coding you can't remember what they were. Fortunately someone thought of this and made several several search functions.

#### Search everywhere:  
**Shift Shift** (Windows, Linux, Mac)  
This searches literally everywhere. Thankfully it groups what it finds into categories, with the most recent files first.  

#### Search for commands:  
**Command + Shift + A** (Mac)  
**Control + Shift + A** (Windows, Linux)  
This searches for any command. If you know there is a way to jump to the next error in your code but you can't remember what it is, just use this command and start typing "error" and it will intelligently find it. This works for any command. If you only want to memorize one shortcut, this is the one.

### Navigation  
Here are a few more ways to keep your hands off the mouse and still get around your project quickly.

#### Jump to Class
**Command + O** (Mac)  
**Control + N** (Windows, Linux)

#### Jump to file  
**Command + Shift + O** (Mac)  
**Control + Shift + N** (Windows, Linux)

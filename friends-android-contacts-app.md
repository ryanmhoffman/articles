# Friends Android App  

Friends is an Android app I'm currently developing. The app is similar to a Contacts app, but it is more like a speed dial app in theory. It only lists your starred contacts, so it makes them more quickly accessible. There are simple actions to call or message your friends from right within the app. It's not exactly like speed dial, but it is a much more filtered contacts list based on who is most important to you.  

## The Idea  
This project began as a simple, if slightly boring replacement for the stock contacts app. As I got into it I realized that I needed to make it not just a boring replacement, but somehow different. When I was scrolling through the contacts on my phone I realized that about 75% of them were people I had talked to about one time. Some others I couldn't even remember who they were. And I saw about ten to fifteen that I used on a regular basis. I wanted a way to filter out all the junk contacts without having to delete them all, because like everyone else, I have to assume I'm going to need their number again, even though I haven't talked to them in years and might not even remember who they are...  

My solution was to create an app that only shows starred contacts. It gives you a much smaller list, and quick actions to call or text immediately.  

When you select a contact from the list it pulls up their details, but not all the excess information you don't need and probably already know. It shows you their number and allows you to quick dial them. It also shows a box with the last text message you received from them as a reminder to what your last coversation was about. It lets you quickly message them as well.  

## The Limitations  
When creating this app, I purposely set some limitations for what it could do. There were certain features that I decided were essential for what I was trying to create, and other things that I felt were not necessary and should not be a part of the app. There were three main things that came to mind that are an essential part of a normal contacts app but are not implemented in any way in Friends. Those three things are to create, edit, and delete contacts.  

I didn't want to be able to add or delete contacts from within the app. The main reason to use it is to gain quick access to your most used contacts. Adding or deleting contacts is not a function you would need for this type of contact very often, so I left it out intentionally.  

In that same vein, I also left out the ability to edit contacts. People don't change their contact info very often, and if you really need to edit their info the stock app works great for that. These functions are not what this app was built to do.  

## The Purpose  
As stated previously, Friends was designed to be a quick and easy way to gain access to your most frequently used contacts without having to filter through all your other "spam" contacts. It is a type of "group speed dial" where all your favorites are put at your fingertips in a much more easy to manage design.  

## Release Schedule  
Friends is still under heavy development, but I plan to release it early next year. I know that could mean a lot of things, so to clarify I'm thinking within the first two weeks of January it should be released. It may only be a beta version, or without a couple extra planned features, but that is the schedule I would like to stick to as closely as possible.  

I plan to update this post over the next couple of weeks with the progress on development and release schedule. It should prove to be a quick process, so hopefully there won't be many updates needed.
